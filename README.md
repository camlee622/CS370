Current/Emerging Trends in CS

*Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I created a small piece of code that had the agent make a random move and helped the agent learn about it's losses and attempt to find the hidden treasure located on a map. I was given the two associated python files that helped the agent determine losses and "see" the treasure map. 

*What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Computer Scientists utilize the power of computers to enhance humans way of thinking and completing tasks. It's important work to try to advance what tasks we are capable of completing. Think back to a simple time when computers were used to compute mathematical problems. This was a very useful task, but we have since expanded greatly the potential for computational tasks.

*How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I approach a problem like I would any other problem... with logic and critical thinking. It's important to question things for their face value and think of X vs. Y (I want X to happen, so I need to do Y). Breaking this down into smaller tasks within a bigger program helps figure out a gameplan for completing the task.

*What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are to remain transparent and faithful to staying within the boundaries of ethical behavior. My goal in my computer science career is to remain ethical and leave a positive impact on the world with anything I create.
